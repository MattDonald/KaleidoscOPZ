# KaleidoscOPZ

A simple Kaleidoscope patch made in Unity, with Teenage Engineering's VideoLab for the [OP-Z](https://teenage.engineering/products/op-z).

This is a test project for leanring Unity & [Video Lab](https://github.com/teenageengineering/videolab/) given here for possible collaboration & fun. This test has been based hugely on the 'Primative' VideoLab Test Pak created by [Keijiro](https://github.com/keijiro/VideolabTest) & thus is not shared as a original but simply an exploration / extention.

You can grab the exported VideoPak [here](https://github.com/DesignedByM/KaleidoscOPZ/tree/master/kaleidoscopz).

**_Please note, this is using the Video Lab 1.3 release & thus you need to be member of the OP-Z Beta Test to have the test App. It will not work on the public release._**
